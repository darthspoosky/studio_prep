/daily-quiz/ncert-foundation/session    # NCERT-based questions
/daily-quiz/past-year/session          # Previous year questions
/daily-quiz/subject-wise/session       # Subject-specific practice
/daily-quiz/current-affairs-basic/session
/daily-quiz/current-affairs-advanced/session
/daily-quiz/mock-prelims/session       # Full-length tests
/daily-quiz/adaptive/session           # AI-adaptive difficulty
/daily-quiz/topper-bank/session        # Premium content
/daily-quiz/final-revision/session     # Revision questions
```

**Implementation Required:**
- Quiz session component with timer
- Question display with options
- Progress bar and navigation
- Answer submission handling
- Review and explanation screens

### 2. Quiz Session Management API
**Missing API Routes:**
```bash
/api/daily-quiz/start-session          # Initialize quiz session
/api/daily-quiz/submit-answer          # Submit individual answers
/api/daily-quiz/complete-session       # Finalize session
/api/daily-quiz/get-session           # Resume interrupted session
/api/daily-quiz/get-results           # Get detailed results
```

### 3. Quiz Taking Interface Components
**Components to Build:**
- `QuizSessionLayout.tsx` - Main quiz interface
- `QuestionCard.tsx` - Individual question display
- `TimerComponent.tsx` - Session and question timers
- `ProgressTracker.tsx` - Visual progress indicator
- `ResultsSummary.tsx` - Post-quiz results
- `ExplanationModal.tsx` - Answer explanations
- `BookmarkButton.tsx` - Save questions for review

### 4. Real-time Progress Tracking
**Database Schema Extensions:**
```typescript
interface QuizSession {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  quizType: string;
  startTime: Timestamp;
  endTime?: Timestamp;
  currentQuestionIndex: number;
  answers: {
    questionId: string;
    selectedOption: string;
    timeSpent: number;
    isCorrect: boolean;
    bookmarked: boolean;
  }[];
  completed: boolean;
  score: number;
  totalQuestions: number;
  difficulty: string;
  subject: string;
}
```
