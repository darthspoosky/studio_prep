  │   ├── layout/             
  │   │   ├── LeftSidebar.tsx
  │   │   ├── RightSidebar.tsx
  │   │   └── MobileHeader.tsx
  │   ├── cards/
  │   │   ├── StatCard.tsx
  │   │   └── HistoryCard.tsx
  │   ├── charts/
  │   │   ├── DailyGoalChart.tsx
  │   │   ├── QuestionsBySubjectChart.tsx
  │   │   └── WeeklyAccuracyChart.tsx
  │   └── widgets/
  │       ├── ActivityHistoryWidget.tsx
  │       ├── PerformanceWidget.tsx
  │       └── ScheduleWidget.tsx
  ├── hooks/                   # Dashboard-specific hooks

## Progress Tracking

### Current Focus
- Testing and refining the new glassmorphic dashboard implementation.
- Improving performance and responsive behavior.

### Completed Tasks
- Modular directory structure created.
- All core components extracted and refactored with glassmorphic style.
- Dashboard page errors (recharts import, type issues) fixed.
- Shared glassmorphic styles system created.
- True glassmorphic design implemented across all components (high transparency backgrounds, strong backdrop blur, gradient overlays, subtle borders, floating card-like components with shadows and animations).
- New complete glassmorphic dashboard implementation in `dashboardNew.tsx` (Note: This file was not found in the provided directory listing).
- Improved animations and interaction effects added.
- Layout reorganized for better visual hierarchy.
- Question Banks added to main dashboard body.
- Visual richness enhanced with gradients and subtle effects.

### Next Steps
- Test and refine the new glassmorphic dashboard implementation.
- Review responsive behavior on mobile devices.
- Consider potential improvements for data fetching using React Query.
- Get user feedback on the new design to utilize all extracted components.

### Remaining for Phase 1: Modularization and Architecture Setup
- **Component Extraction:**
    - Create widget components (ActivityHistoryWidget, PerformanceWidget, ScheduleWidget).
- **Data Management Improvements:**
    - Set up React Query for data fetching.
    - Create custom data hooks (useDashboardData, useUserProgress).
    - Implement TypeScript interfaces for widget types, dashboard data models, and user statistics.
- **Testing Infrastructure:**
    - Set up testing framework for components.
    - Create test utilities for mocking data.
    - Create initial component tests.
