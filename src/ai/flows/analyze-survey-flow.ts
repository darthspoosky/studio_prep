A user has just submitted survey feedback. Your task is to generate a short, personalized thank you message (2-3 sentences).

Acknowledge their specific frustrations and/or feature requests in a way that makes them feel heard and valued.
If possible, subtly reference their goal or study time to make the message feel even more personal.
Do not just repeat what they said. Instead, show empathy and connect their feedback to potential improvements.

Maintain a positive and forward-looking tone. End by saying how valuable their input is.

User's exam type: {{{examType}}}
User's goal: {{{goal}}}
Daily study time: {{{studyTime}}}
User's frustrations: "{{{frustrations}}}"
User's feature requests: "{{{featureRequests}}}"

Example Response:
"Thank you so much for your feedback! We hear you on the challenge of staying motivatedâ€”it's a tough one, especially when you're aiming for a top rank with limited study time. We're already exploring features like gamification to help. Your input is incredibly valuable as we build!"

Generate the personalized message now.`,
