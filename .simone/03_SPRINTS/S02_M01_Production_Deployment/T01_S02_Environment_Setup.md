- [ ] `MAX_CONCURRENT_PROCESSING` set to appropriate value (default: 5)
- [ ] `NODE_ENV` set to production
- [ ] All Firebase environment variables validated

### API Key Configuration
- [ ] Google AI Studio account verified
- [ ] Gemini API key generated and active
- [ ] API quota limits checked and sufficient
- [ ] API key permissions validated for generative AI access
- [ ] Rate limiting configured appropriately

### System Dependencies

- [ ] Required npm packages installed (pdf-parse, sharp, @google/generative-ai)
- [ ] Firebase SDK properly configured
- [ ] Database connections tested
- [ ] File system permissions validated

### Security Configuration
- [ ] Environment variables stored securely
- [ ] API keys not exposed in client-side code
- [ ] Temporary file directory has proper access controls
- [ ] CORS settings configured for production
- [ ] Security headers implemented

## Technical Requirements

### Required Environment Variables
```env
# AI Service Configuration
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# File Processing Configuration
TEMP_FILE_DIRECTORY=/app/temp
MAX_FILE_SIZE=52428800
MAX_CONCURRENT_PROCESSING=5
CLEANUP_INTERVAL=300000

# Firebase Configuration
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your_client_email

# Security Configuration
NODE_ENV=production
CORS_ORIGIN=https://yourapp.com
```

### Directory Structure
```
/app/
├── temp/                    # Temporary file storage
├── logs/                    # Application logs
├── uploads/                 # File upload staging
└── backups/                 # System backups
```

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Google AI API Setup
1. Access Google AI Studio (https://aistudio.google.com/)
2. Create new project or select existing
3. Generate API key for Gemini model
4. Test API key with sample request
5. Configure rate limiting and quotas

### Step 2: Environment Configuration
1. Create `.env.production` file
2. Add all required environment variables
3. Validate variable values and formats
4. Test environment loading
5. Document configuration requirements

### Step 3: System Dependencies
1. Verify Node.js version compatibility
2. Install production dependencies
3. Run `npm audit` for security vulnerabilities
4. Configure Firebase Admin SDK
5. Test database connections

### Step 4: File System Setup
1. Create temporary directory with proper permissions
2. Set up log rotation for application logs
3. Configure file cleanup schedules
4. Test file upload/download functionality
5. Validate disk space monitoring

### Step 5: Security Validation
1. Review environment variable security
2. Test API key access restrictions
3. Validate file access permissions
4. Check for exposed secrets
5. Configure security headers

## Testing Criteria

### Configuration Tests
- [ ] Environment variables load correctly
- [ ] API key authenticates successfully
- [ ] File operations work with configured paths
- [ ] Database connections establish properly
- [ ] Security settings are effective

### Integration Tests
- [ ] File processing service initializes
- [ ] AI service responds to requests
- [ ] Database operations complete successfully
- [ ] Error handling works as expected
- [ ] Performance meets baseline requirements

## Success Metrics

### Performance Benchmarks
- Environment initialization: <5 seconds
- API key validation: <2 seconds
- Database connection: <3 seconds
- File system operations: <1 second
- Memory usage: <500MB at startup

### Quality Indicators
- All environment variables validated
- API key active and functional
- Zero security vulnerabilities
- All dependencies installed correctly
- System health checks passing

## Deliverables

### Configuration Files
- [ ] `.env.production` with all required variables
- [ ] `ecosystem.config.js` for PM2 deployment
- [ ] `docker-compose.yml` for containerized deployment
- [ ] `nginx.conf` for reverse proxy configuration

### Documentation
- [ ] Environment setup guide
- [ ] API key generation instructions
- [ ] Security configuration checklist
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide

### Scripts
- [ ] Setup script for automated configuration
- [ ] Health check script
- [ ] Backup and restore scripts
- [ ] Monitoring setup script

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Google AI Studio account access
- Firebase project with proper permissions
- Production server environment
- SSL certificates for HTTPS

### Internal Dependencies
- Completed file processing services
- Database schema in place
- Application code deployed
- Monitoring infrastructure ready

## Risk Mitigation

### High Priority Risks
1. **API Key Issues**: Invalid or expired keys
   - *Mitigation*: Automated validation and alerting
2. **Permission Errors**: File system access denied
   - *Mitigation*: Proper setup scripts and validation
3. **Configuration Errors**: Invalid environment variables
   - *Mitigation*: Validation scripts and documentation

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Dependency Issues**: Missing or incompatible packages
   - *Mitigation*: Lock files and automated testing
2. **Resource Constraints**: Insufficient system resources
   - *Mitigation*: Resource monitoring and scaling

## Validation Steps

### Pre-deployment Checklist
- [ ] All environment variables configured
- [ ] API keys validated and active
- [ ] Dependencies installed and compatible
- [ ] Security settings verified
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

### Post-deployment Verification
- [ ] Application starts successfully
- [ ] Health checks pass
- [ ] File processing works
- [ ] Database operations functional
- [ ] Monitoring systems active

## Notes

### Important Considerations
- Environment variables should be encrypted at rest
- API keys should have minimal required permissions
- Regular rotation of sensitive credentials
- Monitoring of API usage and quotas
- Backup of configuration files

### Common Issues
- Permission denied errors on temp directory
- API key format or encoding issues
- Firebase configuration mismatches
- Network connectivity problems
- Resource limitation errors
