## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Google AI API access and quota
- Firebase project configuration
- Production server environment
- Test file samples (UPSC papers)

### Internal Dependencies
- Completed file processing services (S01)
- Database structure in place
- Admin interface functional
- API endpoints implemented

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- **Processing Speed**: <30 seconds per file
- **Success Rate**: >95% for standard files
- **Concurrent Users**: Support 5 simultaneous uploads
- **Memory Usage**: <2GB per processing session

### Quality Metrics
- **Extraction Accuracy**: >90% for standard question formats
- **Error Rate**: <1% processing failures
- **System Uptime**: 99.9% availability
- **Response Time**: <2 seconds for status checks

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. **AI API Rate Limits**: Google AI service quotas
   - *Mitigation*: Implement queuing and retry logic
2. **File Processing Failures**: Complex or corrupted files
   - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive validation and fallback
3. **Memory Issues**: Large file processing
   - *Mitigation*: Streaming and resource monitoring

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Configuration Errors**: Environment setup issues
   - *Mitigation*: Detailed setup documentation
2. **Database Connection Issues**: Firestore connectivity
   - *Mitigation*: Connection pooling and retry logic
