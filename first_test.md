# Test Execution Summary

All tests were executed on the dedicated testing branch. The following unit tests were added:

- `Card` component rendering
- `LeftSidebar` navigation links
- `getUserUsage` service function

Jest was configured with `ts-jest` using a dedicated `tsconfig.jest.json` to properly handle JSX. After installing dependencies, `npm test` reported all suites passing.

## Results

```
PASS src/components/ui/card.test.tsx
PASS src/components/ui/button.test.tsx
PASS src/services/usageService.test.ts
PASS src/app/dashboard/components/layout/LeftSidebar.test.tsx
```

Linting and type checking reveal existing issues unrelated to the new tests. They remain to be addressed separately.

## Suggestions

- Integrate CI to run `npm test`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run typecheck` on pull requests.
- Gradually increase coverage by adding tests for remaining components and services.

All testing was performed on this branch before merging to `master`.
