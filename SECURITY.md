# Security Considerations

## Known Dependencies Vulnerabilities

### xlsx Package (SheetJS) - HIGH SEVERITY
**Status**: Known Issue - Mitigation Implemented
**CVE**: GHSA-4r6h-8v6p-xvw6, GHSA-5pgg-2g8v-p4x9
**Description**: Prototype Pollution and ReDoS vulnerabilities in xlsx package

#### Impact Assessment
- **Risk Level**: LOW (due to mitigation)
- **Usage**: Limited to admin file upload functionality
- **Exposure**: Only affects admin users uploading Excel files
- **User Data**: No end-user data processing

#### Mitigation Strategies Implemented
1. **Admin-Only Access**: Excel upload functionality restricted to admin users
2. **File Size Limits**: Maximum 10MB upload limit
3. **File Type Validation**: Strict MIME type checking
4. **Input Sanitization**: File content validation before processing
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling for malformed files
6. **Monitoring**: File upload attempts are logged for security monitoring

#### Alternative Solutions Considered
- **Replace xlsx**: No viable alternatives with same Excel compatibility
- **Remove Feature**: Excel upload is core business requirement
- **Sandboxing**: Implemented via strict admin access controls

#### Monitoring and Detection
- All Excel file uploads are logged with user ID and timestamp
- Failed upload attempts trigger security alerts
- File processing errors are monitored for potential exploit attempts

#### Future Actions
- Monitor xlsx package for security updates
- Consider implementing server-side sandboxing for file processing
- Evaluate alternative Excel processing libraries as they mature

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- Firebase Authentication with role-based access control
- Admin routes protected with authentication middleware
- API endpoints validate user permissions before processing

### Input Validation
- All user inputs sanitized and validated
- File upload restrictions (size, type, content)
- SQL injection prevention through Firebase Firestore
- XSS prevention through React's built-in escaping

### Data Protection
- Sensitive data encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
- API keys stored in environment variables
- User data segregated by authentication
- Session management via Firebase Auth

### API Security
- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- CORS properly configured
- Request validation on all endpoints
- Error messages don't expose sensitive information

### Frontend Security
- Content Security Policy headers
- Secure cookie settings
- No sensitive data in localStorage
- React's XSS protection enabled

## Security Monitoring

### Logging and Monitoring
- User authentication events logged
- File upload attempts tracked
- API endpoint usage monitored
- Error rates and patterns analyzed

### Incident Response
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring alerts
2. **Assessment**: Security team evaluation
3. **Containment**: Immediate access restriction if needed
4. **Recovery**: Data integrity verification
5. **Lessons Learned**: Security measures improvement

## Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to:
- **Email**: security@[company-domain].com
- **Response Time**: 24-48 hours
- **Disclosure**: Responsible disclosure policy

## Regular Security Audits

### Dependency Management
- Weekly `npm audit` checks
- Automated dependency updates for security patches
- Quarterly security review of all dependencies

### Code Security
- Static analysis tools integrated in CI/CD
- Regular penetration testing
- Code review process includes security checklist

### Infrastructure Security
- Firebase security rules regularly audited
- Environment variables rotation
- Access logs reviewed monthly

## Compliance & Standards

### Data Protection
- User data minimization principles
- Retention policies implemented
- Right to deletion respected

### Security Standards
- Following OWASP security guidelines
- Regular security training for development team
- Security-first development practices
